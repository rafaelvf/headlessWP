Welcome to the Wordpress headless CMS backend + Database.

To locally run this backend, I have uploaded all the Wordpress files that you will need.
Notice the DB is in SQL, and it is in a folder called SQL DB.

If you have never run a Wordpress proyect you will need a program like MAMP, so it would be easier tu run all.
