Welcome to the Wordpress headless CMS backend + Database.

To locally run this backend, I have uploaded all the Wordpress files that you will need.
Notice the DB is in SQL, and it is in a folder called SQL DB. The name of my database is wordpress.
You need to upload this DB when you run it.
Then just run the wordpress, if you have never run a Wordpress proyect you will need a program like MAMP, so it would be easier tu run all.
